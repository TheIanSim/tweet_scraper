steps:

0. update parameters/filepaths used in scripts. (configuration.ini) 
1. [python: data_extraction.py] extract tweets data and output the raw dataset file and a file which store the counts of tweets for different account and keywords
2. update the file path of the raw dataset file in configuration.ini
3. [pyspark dataframe: data_preprocessing_new.py] read raw dataset file and perform data cleaning and also calculate the sentiment scores and save the output dataset file
4. update the file path of the clean dataset file in configuration.ini
5. [python: display_new_dataset.py] have an overview (data examples and data count) of the dataset file
6. [IPython Notebook: CS5344 Project Model.ipynb] update the dataset file path in CS5344 Project Model.ipynb and run the code to perform analysis.

Note:
A small dataset file (tweets_files/test_dataset.csv) is used to show the pyspark code is working.
